# Image Detection with Keras and Wave

Using open source Keras and Grad-CAM the user can upload their own photos 
and get explainable predictions of what a standard, pre-trained model 
thinks is in the image. This app makes these open source tools more 
accessible by adding a easy-to-use front end.

This app can be used as a template for Wave App developers on how to 
integrate third-party modeling frameworks into your own apps. Find the

**Keras:** Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top 
of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus 
on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as 
fast as possible is key to doing good research.

**H2O Wave:** H2O Wave is an open-source Python development framework that 
makes it fast and easy for data scientists, machine learning engineers, 
and software developers to develop real-time interactive AI apps with 
sophisticated visualizations.
